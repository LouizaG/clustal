# Multiple Sequence Alignment


## Project Description

The program computes multiple sequence alignments based on the methodology outlined in this specific research paper [Desmond G. Higgins, Paul M. Sharp, Fast and sensitive multiple sequence alignments on a microcomputer, Bioinformatics, Volume 5, Issue 2, April 1989, Pages 151â€“153,] (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/5.2.151)
It leverages dynamic programming to progressively align sequences according to an initial phylogenetic tree's branching order.
